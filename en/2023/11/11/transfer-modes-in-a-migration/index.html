<small>(2023-10-11)</small></div><p>In computer science, a migration project involves changing one or more technical
components without impacting any application behaviors. In the realm of
databases (and the profession I practice), it will involve choosing a new system
(such as PostgreSQL) to replace another (such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL
Server).</p><p>In a <a href=/2021/12/06/migrer-vers-postgresql/>previous article</a> (French), I described exhaustive steps to perform a
complete migration using Foreign Data Wrappers technology. However, the critical
data transfer step described there does not suit all situations. Let&rsquo;s explore
together the alternatives that cover a large portion of the needs.</p><div class=message>The illustrations in this article depict a simple migration project scenario
where data is transferred from one system to another between two data centers
(<em>dc1</em> to <em>dc2</em>). In a situation where the data does not leave the hosting
infrastructure, it is a straightforward transfer between two separate servers.</div><hr><h2 id=transfer-without-a-network>Transfer without a network</h2><p><img src=/img/en/2023-10-networkless-transfer.png alt="Indirect transfer between two systems"></p><p>Several reasons can justify that the two servers are not in direct connection
with each other. This includes the prohibition of opening access to the source
instance from the internet or the complexity of configuring a secure link (VPN)
between the two infrastructures.</p><p>In such a scenario, it becomes necessary to dump the data outside the database
while ensuring the consistency of the data. A physical backup of the database or
an export in SQL format are reliable means to consolidate a complete archive of
the database.</p><p>The transfer step is carried out according to the imagination of the teams. The
simplest method is to transfer to an SFTP repository provided by the second data
center or any other protocol that checks the integrity of the archive once
transferred. The most unlikely method I have observed was the physical movement
of a copy of the archive by a specialized courier company, by car, scooter, or
plane depending on the distance to cover.</p><p>Once the archive is received by the teams and deemed intact, it may be necessary
to import the data into a buffer database, provided that the file format (SQL or
proprietary) is not yet compatible with PostgreSQL. From this precise moment, it
is then possible to import the data into the target database respecting the
order of object creations and data insertion.</p><p><strong>Operation Summary</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Very high</strong> downtime (from several hours to several days);</li><li>Implementation complexity is <strong>low</strong> with the right tools;</li><li>Risk of data consistency issues is <strong>very low</strong> if integrity checks are
performed at each step.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=transfer-with-intermediary>Transfer with intermediary</h2><p><img src=/img/en/2023-10-intermediary-transfer.png alt="Indirect transfer with an ETL"></p><p>When the systems are hosted in the same location, setting up routing rules
allows for easier connection between the two servers. Among the migration tools,
we find the family of ETL (Extract Transform Load) tools that act as
intermediaries between the two databases.</p><p>These tools provide a large number of connection drivers as well as data
transformation methods to orchestrate migration without the need to export any
table to a flat file. The bulk of the work is done in memory and with the help
of multiple processors to speed up transfer operations.</p><p>Although specialized for migrations to PostgreSQL, I classify the open-source
tool <a href=ora2pg.darold.net/>Ora2Pg</a> in the category of ETL. It precisely meets the previous
definition by opening multiple connections to the source instance to read tables
in batches of 10,000 rows (using the <code>DATA_LIMIT</code> directive) and opening other
connections to the target instance to insert them with <code>COPY</code> instructions,
thanks to the <a href=https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::Pg#pg_putcopydata target=_blank rel=noopener><code>pg_putcopydata</code></a> method of the <code>DBD::Pg</code> driver.</p><p><strong>Operation Summary</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>High</strong> downtime (several hours);</li><li><strong>Low</strong> implementation complexity with the right tools;</li><li><strong>Very low</strong> risk to data consistency.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=direct-transfer>Direct transfer</h2><p><img src=/img/en/2023-10-direct-transfer.png alt="Direct transfer"></p><p>This mode should feel familiar if you are a regular reader (subscribe!) because
direct transfer between a third-party system and PostgreSQL relies on the
technology of Foreign Data Wrappers.</p><p>This solution opens a direct channel between the PostgreSQL instance and the
remote instance through external tables. Thus, it becomes possible to query the
data with SQL, provided that a wrapper has been developed to communicate with
the correct driver.</p><p>The extraction, transfer, and insertion operations are performed in the same
transaction: it&rsquo;s a simple <code>INSERT INTO SELECT</code> query. This method is
<a href=https://www.migops.com/blog/ora2pg-now-supports-oracle_fdw-to-increase-the-data-migration-speed/ target=_blank rel=noopener>faster</a> than the previous mode since it eliminates a resource-intensive
intermediary (ETL).</p><p>Although appealing, copying through a wrapper can be particularly slow for large
data (such as Oracle&rsquo;s BLOBs) because they have a different structure. It is
then necessary to mix solutions: one with a direct transfer for tables without
large data and the other with an ETL to optimize the volume of rows and the
amount of memory to allocate.</p><p><strong>Operation Summary</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Downtime</strong>: <strong>High</strong> (from several minutes to several hours);</li><li><strong>Implementation Complexity</strong>: <strong>Low</strong> to <strong>High</strong> for large data;</li><li><strong>Risk to Data Consistency</strong>: <strong>Very Low</strong>.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=partial-catch-up-transfer>Partial catch-up transfer</h2><p><img src=/img/en/2023-10-dead-transfer.png alt="Partial catch-up transfer"></p><p>For very large volumes where service interruption must be kept to a minimum, the
solutions mentioned above can be very limiting. Exporting/importing the entire
dataset is a lengthy and unavoidable step.</p><p>What I refer to as the &ldquo;partial catch-up transfer&rdquo; involves identifying the
largest tables with mostly dead rows. It requires assurance that no <code>UPDATE</code> or
<code>DELETE</code> modifications occur from the development team and that the table has a
primary key where new values during an insertion are always greater than the
previous.</p><p>Thus, an initial copy of the data can be performed live, without service
interruption, where only the dead rows will be moved to the new system.
Depending on the proportion of the complete volume, this step can save dozens of
hours in the final operation. In addition to the transfer operations, it is
necessary to maintain a register of primary key values that separates dead data
from live (or upcoming) data. For each table, this value will be a kind of
checkpoint for the catch-up phase.</p><p>During the crucial switch step, all live tables will be entirely copied, and the
rows from dead tables whose key is greater than the memorized value will be
selected and then inserted into their respective table. A preliminary study must
determine whether indexes deserve to be created during the first or second
transfer step, depending on the effective time they save or consume throughout
the entire operation.</p><p><strong>Operation Summary</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Low</strong> downtime (several tens of minutes);</li><li><strong>High</strong> implementation complexity;</li><li><strong>High</strong> risk of data consistency issues if the development team does not
provide sufficient guarantees in choosing dead tables.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=transfer-with-transaction-replay>Transfer with transaction replay</h2><p><img src=/img/en/2023-10-replay-transfer.png alt="Transfer with transaction replay"></p><p>Speaking of &ldquo;transaction replay&rdquo; is essentially referring to physical
replication or logical replication. Each system has its own mechanisms, and the
tools to implement them can vary. I recommend looking into excellent projects
like <a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/ora_migrator#replication target=_blank rel=noopener>ora_migrator</a>, which implements replication using triggers with Oracle,
and <a href=https://pgchameleon.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>pg_chameleon</a>, which decodes transaction logs from MySQL.</p><p>The main advantage of this transfer mode lies in the system&rsquo;s ability to log all
modifications requested and record them in a sequence of transactions. Thus,
between time <em>T0</em> and time <em>T1</em>, it becomes possible to reproduce all changes to
achieve a consistent and faithful state.</p><p>In this scenario, the operation requires a full and coherent data load into the
target database. This initialization phase occurs without service interruption
but requires particular care in monitoring disks or system source alerts because
capturing data maintains a snapshot that can become costly if the transfer takes
too long.</p><p>At the end of initialization, the replay can start without penalizing the
production source database&rsquo;s activity. The tool consumes each event in the order
of arrival to transform it into an insert (<code>INSERT</code>), update (<code>UPDATE</code>), or
delete (<code>DELETE</code>) in the PostgreSQL database. The cutover operation then
consists of prohibiting any new modification to the source system, waiting for
the end of replay, and changing the connection strings so that applications
connect to the new PostgreSQL database.</p><p><strong>Operation Summary</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Very low</strong> downtime (a few seconds);</li><li>Implementation complexity is <strong>high</strong>, even <strong>very high</strong> depending on the
chosen solutions;</li><li>Risk of data consistency issues is <strong>very high</strong> if the tool fails for a
transaction it cannot decode during the replay step.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=freedom-of-choice>Freedom of Choice</h2><p>This comprehensive review had been on my mind for some time, and it seemed
necessary to shed light on the various constraints posed by a migration project.
In the sphere of consultants I interact with and the open-source projects I
actively monitor, I try to convince myself that there could be a universal
solution capable of addressing every need and situation outlined in this
article.</p><p>I deliberately avoided discussing the <a href=https://debezium.io/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Debezium</a> project because it relies on
many technical components like Kafka, Java, and a myriad of connectors. Although
a <a href="https://youtu.be/IOJLFWXj4pA?si=FiQ7c2veWrNI2Yno" target=_blank rel=noopener>conference</a> (French) on this topic kept me engaged last June, I haven&rsquo;t
yet had the opportunity to lead a large-scale project that justified such a
significant human investment in its implementation.</p><p>There are numerous free or paid tools, each with its own purpose and philosophy.
Choosing one over another depends on the migration teams and their technical
maturity, but ultimately, the choice is free!</p></article></main><footer class=footer><small>&copy; 2019-<time datetime=2023-11-11>2023</time>
