&lt;p>The parser stage creates a parse tree using only fixed rules about the syntactic
structure of SQL. It does not make any lookups in the system catalogs, so there
is no possibility to understand the detailed semantics of the requested operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Documentation: &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/parser-stage.html#id-1.10.3.6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transformation Process&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>What is going on from when a user sends his SQL query to getting back a data result?
This passionating question (by a limited amount of people, of course) has been
studied by Stefan Simkovics during his &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/Enhancement_of_the_ANSI_SQL_Implementation_of_PostgreSQL/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master&amp;rsquo;s Thesis&lt;/a> at Vienna University of
Technology in 1998.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His remarkable work was added in &lt;a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official documentation&lt;/a> as &amp;ldquo;Overview of
PostgreSQL Internals&amp;rdquo;, which is intended to share Simkovics&amp;rsquo; research in a
simplified way to reach a larger audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this article, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to share recent thoughts about a subelement of
these internals, the parser. It relies on a similar approach to compiling by
using an advanced development pattern called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AST&lt;/a> (abstract syntax tree).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
