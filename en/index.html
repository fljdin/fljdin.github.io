&ldquo;window&rdquo; and perform calculations on that window. By using these functions, you
can create more advanced and efficient queries for analyzing your database.</p><p>In early 2023, I contributed to a project that converts data models to
PostgreSQL, called <a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator target=_blank rel=noopener>db_migrator</a>. On this occasion, I (re)discovered the
power of these <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html target=_blank rel=noopener>window functions</a> with the SQL language. In this article, I
revisit a <a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator/pull/11 target=_blank rel=noopener>specific case</a> of transforming the upper bounds of a partitioned
table into an array of boundaries.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/12/17/window-functions-to-the-rescue/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/11/25/substituting-a-variable-in-a-sql-script/>Substituting a variable in a SQL script</a></h1><time datetime=2024-11-25 class=post-date>25 nov 2024</time><p>In a world where we constantly seek to automate repetitive tasks, it is common
to write down a query in a script, make it more convenient, and eventually
integrate the whole thing into a project&rsquo;s codebase. Tools like SQL*Plus and
psql can be powerful allies in this game, as relevant as Bash or Python
interpreters.</p><p>In several projects I have been involved in, I have come across a large number
of those kinds of scripts. Some of them have the particularity of offering input
parameters, processed by SQL*Plus with the very comfortable mechanism named
variable substitution. In this article, I share some tips to convert them to an
equivalent syntax that PostgreSQL&rsquo;s psql tool can parse and manage.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/11/25/substituting-a-variable-in-a-sql-script/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/09/19/hierarchical-data-types/>Hierarchical data types</a></h1><time datetime=2024-09-19 class=post-date>19 sep 2024</time><p>The SQL standard defines a set of rules so that database systems can be interchangeable,
but there are small singularities in the wild. In this regard, the <code>hierarchyid</code> data type
provided by SQL Server is a striking example. If you are switching to PostgreSQL, two
solutions are available to you.</p><p>A first and simpler solution consists in linking each node to its parent using a new
<code>parentid</code> column and applying a foreign key constraint. Another, more complete approach
consists in using the <code>ltree</code> extension. This article deals with the latter case.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/09/19/hierarchical-data-types/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/07/30/how-to-keep-a-community-alive/>How to keep a community alive</a></h1><time datetime=2024-07-30 class=post-date>30 jul 2024</time><p>The <a href=https://pgday.fr/ target=_blank rel=noopener>PG Day France</a> took place on June 11th and 12th in Lille, my hometown.
It is the event of the French PostgreSQL community that settles in a different city each year.
The opportunity was too good for me and I met many people from all over France and its surroundings,
to discuss PostgreSQL during two days of workshops and conferences.</p><p>For this edition, I had the pleasure of speaking and sharing my experience on the animation of
the local Meetup group that I took over four years ago. In this article, I want to write down the
main points discussed during this presentation, while waiting for the video of the conference to be
posted online.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/07/30/how-to-keep-a-community-alive/>Read more</a></small></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/05/28/an-assistant-to-copy-data-from-a-remote-server/>An assistant to copy data from a remote server</a></h1><time datetime=2024-05-28 class=post-date>28 may 2024</time><p>During the last PGSession organized by Dalibo, I wrote and led a <a href=https://dali.bo/wsfdw_html target=_blank rel=noopener>workshop</a>
(french) on the migration to PostgreSQL using Foreign Data Wrappers, or FDW.
This was an opportunity to present to the general public the <a href=https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/db_migrator target=_blank rel=noopener><code>db_migrator</code></a>
extension for which I wrote an <a href=/en/2023/07/28/on-the-road-to-freedom-with-db_migrator/>article</a> on this blog.</p><p>While working on this workshop, we noticed that copying data with the
<code>db_migrator</code> extension is not perfectly supported. Indeed, although there is a
low-level function to distribute the transfer table by table over several
processes, many situations will require writing a large number of SQL queries to
get out of trouble. Over the following months, I worked on the design of an
<a href=https://github.com/fljdin/fdw-assistant target=_blank rel=noopener>assistant</a> written in PL/pgSQL whose purpose is to simplify the generation
of these queries.</p><small>» <a href=https://fljd.in/en/2024/05/28/an-assistant-to-copy-data-from-a-remote-server/>Read more</a></small></article></div><div class=pagination><a class="pagination-item older" href=/en/page/2/>Previous page</a>
