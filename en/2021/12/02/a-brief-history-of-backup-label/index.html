<small>(2021-01-19)</small></div><p>For a long time, I remained ignorant about <a href=http://www.interdb.jp/pg/pgsql09.html target=_blank rel=noopener>transaction logging mechanisms</a>
and PITR in PostgreSQL, although they were crucial in data durability. A better
understanding of these concepts would have helped me in a previous life, to be
more confident during a backup configuration and, well, during after-crash
intervention!</p><p>By reading this post, I will come back to an amusing file that used to be a
topic of discussion over the past decade: the backup label file. What is it and
what is it used for? How has it be enhanced from its origin with PostgreSQL 8.0
and what could be expected from him over the next years?</p><hr><h2 id=once-upon-a-time-there-was-transaction-logging>Once upon a time there was transaction logging</h2><p>As an introduction and to better understand this post, it seems good to me to
explain that each changing operation in PostgreSQL, like an <code>UPDATE</code> or an <code>INSERT</code>,
is written a first time on <code>COMMIT</code> in a group of files, which is called <em>WAL</em>
or <strong>transaction logs</strong>. Taken together, these changes represent a low cost to
disk activity compared to random writings of others processes at work in PostgreSQL.</p><p>Among them, the <code>checkpointer</code> process ensures that new data in memory is permanently
synchronized in the data files and that at regular times called <code>CHECKPOINT</code>. This
on-disk two-step writing provides excellent performance and ensures that modified
blocks are not lost when a transaction ends successfully.</p><p><img src=/img/en/2021-12-asynchronous-writes.png alt="Asynchroneous writes on disks"></p><p>Because of transaction logging, all data files of our cluster are late on real
transactional workload, until the next <code>CHECKPOINT</code> moment. In case of an unexpected
interruption (like a memory crash), dirty pages will be lost and data files are
called <strong>inconsistents</strong>, as they contain data that can be too old or uncommitted.</p><p>In such situations, cluster service will be able to restart by applying losted
changes thanks to transaction logs written in WAL files. This rebuilding process
of data files to their consistent state is simply called <strong>crash recovery</strong>.</p><div class=message>In PostgreSQL 8.0 and above, this mecanism laid the foundation for priceless
functionalities, like Point In Time Recovery or standby replication with Log
Shipping to a secondary cluster.</div><p>Whether after a crash or data restoration, data files must be consistent during
the startup stage in order to accept write access to data again. What a terrible
surprise when the startup fails with the following error:</p><p><code>PANIC: could not locate a valid checkpoint record</code></p><p>At this moment of startup stage, the cluster does not find any consistent point
between data files and fails to look after the nearest checkpoint record. Without
transactions logs, crash recovery fails and stops. At this point, your nerves and
your backup policy are put to the test.</p><p>To put it another way: in lacks of WAL or theirs archives, <u>your most
recent data is lost</u>.</p><p>… And <a href=https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_resetwal.html target=_blank rel=noopener>pg_resetwal</a> will not bring them back to you.</p><hr><h2 id=and-comes-backup-label>And comes backup label</h2><p>After this lovely warning, we will consider that the archiving of transaction logs
is no longer an option when you are making backups. Make sure that these archives
are stored in a secure place, or even a decentralized area so that they are
accessible by all standby clusters when you need to trigger your failover plan.</p><p>For those who have reached this part of the post, you should not be too lost if
I tell you that the <em>backup label</em> file is a component of a larger concept called:
backup.</p><blockquote><p>The backup history file is just a small text file. It contains the label string
you gave to <code>pg_basebackup</code>, as well as the starting and ending times and WAL
segments of the backup. If you used the label to identify the associated dump
file, then the archived history file is enough to tell you which dump file to
restore.</p><p>Source: <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-BASE-BACKUP target=_blank rel=noopener>Making a Base Backup</a></p></blockquote><p>Let’s see the simplest behavior of this documentation-praised tool <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pgbasebackup.html target=_blank rel=noopener>pg_basebackup</a>

means that all present and future WAL segments in subdirectory <code>pg_wal</code> will be
written in a dedicated archive next to the backup, thanks to a temporary
replication slot.</p><p>Since version 13, this tool creates a new manifest backup file in order to verify
the integrity of our backup with <a href=https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_verifybackup.html target=_blank rel=noopener>pg_verifybackup</a>. Let&rsquo;s explore our working

be found in WAL <code>000000010000000000000016</code>. In a lack of a backup label file,
startup process will only have the <a href=https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_control.html target=_blank rel=noopener>control file</a> to obtain the most recent
checkpoint, with no guarantee that it is the right one.</p><hr><h2 id=the-glory-age>The glory age</h2><p>You will agree with me that content and interest of the backup label file are
anecdotal (though essential) in backup architecture with PostgreSQL. It is (just)
a few-lines text file, only needed in some recovery processes.</p><p>And yet, this small revolution caused by version 8.0 in January 2005 with its
new functionality, continuous archiving and PITR mecanism, aroused the
creativity of development team in the years that followed. The backup label
evolved to gain modularity and stability.</p><p>At this time, <code>pg_backbackup</code> was not yet available, and only an explicit call
to the function <a href=https://pgpedia.info/p/pg_start_backup.html target=_blank rel=noopener>pg_start_backup()</a> allowed you to generate the <code>backup_label</code>
file in which were the <a href=https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/REL8_0_STABLE/src/backend/access/transam/xlog.c#L5411 target=_blank rel=noopener>following</a> four entries to support hot backup:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-c data-lang=c><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=cp># backend/access/transam/xlog.c

waiting for archiving. A quick search into our WAL repository can lead us to a
ready-to-use file.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-text data-lang=text><span class=line><span class=cl>$ find archives -type f -not -size 16M

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>With a fresh new architecture for non-exclusive concurrent backup system, various
backup tools have emerged, more powerful and modular than <code>pg_basebackup</code>. Among
well-known third-party tools, you might hear of <a href=https://pgbackrest.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>pgBackRest</a> written in C,
<a href=https://www.pgbarman.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Barman</a> written in Python, or even <a href=https://dalibo.github.io/pitrery/ target=_blank rel=noopener>pitrery</a> written in Bash. Moreover, these
tools do a pretty well-done job, avoiding a painful effort for every administrator
in maintaining their complex scripts.</p><hr><h2 id=moral-of-the-story>Moral of the story</h2><p>Over releases, backup label file has endured many storms and twists to result in
a more elegant way to perform physical backup and restoration with PostgreSQL.</p><p>If you are administrating database cluster, especially in virtualized engine,
I warmly recommend you to check your backup policies and associated tools. It is
not so uncommon for hypervisors to take a system snapshot in exclusive mode
with <code>pg_start_backup()</code> as a pre-hook.</p><p>Above specialized third-party softwares could/must be tested. If they do not fit
your needs, you may study others tricks to make our backups in a concurrent way,
as this <a href=https://www.commandprompt.com/blog/postgresql-non-exclusive-base-Backup-bash/ target=_blank rel=noopener>example</a> with a temporary file made by <code>mkfifo</code> command.</p><p>Old-fashion exclusive backup is deprecated but not removed (yet). It is a real
concern that remains in a standstill, since last Commitfest in <a href=https://commitfest.postgresql.org/28/1913/ target=_blank rel=noopener>July 2020</a>.
In a <a href=https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/d4da3456-06a0-b790-fb07-036d0bd4bf0d%40pgmasters.net target=_blank rel=noopener>thread</a>, contributor David Steele (who made pgBackRest, by the way)
suggested that backup label content could be stored in memory to fix its main
wickness:</p><blockquote><p>It might be easier/better to just keep the one exclusive slot in shared
memory and store the backup label in it. We only allow one exclusive
backup now so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a loss in functionality.</p></blockquote><p>To be continued!</p></article></main><footer class=footer><small>&copy; 2019-<time datetime=2025-10-08>2025</time>
